# 🚀 Verasso V10: Institutional Integration & Optimization

Phase 10 focuses on bridging the decentralized ecosystem of Verasso with real-world financial systems, institutional standards, and optimizing performance for a wider range of hardware.

## 1. Financial Bridge: Real-World Economy 💳

The current "Ledger" system provides a robust offline-first credit system. Phase 10 will integrate standard financial gateways to allow users to move value in and out of the ecosystem.

- **Stripe/PayPal Integration**: Enable fiat-to-credit conversions for mentoring and talent marketplace.
- **Micro-transaction Layer**: Low-fee processing for peer-to-peer talent exchange.
- **Tax & Compliance Module**: Basic reporting for earnings generated within the marketplace.

## 2. GPU Optimization: Low-Draw Mode 🔋

The **Cognitive Dashboard** and high-fidelity simulations are currently GPU-intensive. We need to ensure Verasso remains accessible on mid-tier and budget devices.

- **Level of Detail (LOD) System**: Dynamic adjustment of 3D assets based on device performance.
- **Low-Draw Toggle**: A global setting to switch from "Liquid Glass 2.0" to a simplified "Modern Flat" UI.
- **Shader Optimization**: Refactoring custom Fragment Shaders to reduce clock cycles on integrated mobile GPUs.

## 3. Institutional API: Credentials & Verification 🎓

To move beyond a learning platform to a recognized educational tool, Verasso needs to interface with educational institutions.

- **Open Badges Integration**: Exporting skill verifications as standard Open Badges.
- **LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) Support**: Allowing Verasso simulations to be embedded in external LMS (Learning Management Systems) like Canvas or Moodle.
- **Verified Identity Bridge**: Optional KYC/KYB for professional mentors requiring official certification display.
